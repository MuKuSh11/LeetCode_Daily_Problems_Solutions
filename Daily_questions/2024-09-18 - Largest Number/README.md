# 179. Largest Number

## Question:
Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.
<br/>Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.


## Example:
Example 1:
<br/>Input: nums = [10,2]
<br/>Output: "210"
<br/>
<br/>Example 2:
<br/>Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
<br/>Output: "9534330"


### Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
<br/>0 <= nums[i] <= 109
